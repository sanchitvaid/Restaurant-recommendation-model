# Restaurant-recommendation-model
## Overview
Revamped a B-to-C portal using intelligent automation tech by building different matrices to identify and recommend restaurants. To make sure an effective model 
can be achieved it is important to understand the behaviour of the data in hand and thus performed preliminary data inspection and reported the findings as the structure 
of the data, missing values, duplicates cleaning variable names etc. Based on these findings, explored the geographical distribution of the restaurants, finding out the 
cities with maximum / minimum number of restaurants. Explored how ratings are distributed overall. And finally expressed the results using graphs and plot to make it more
appealing.

## Findings
- There are 43 Indian cities in the dataset out of which New Delhi has the highest number of restaurants. India cities like Panchkula, Mohali have the least presence
- New Delhi has the highest number of restaurants out of all the cities : 5473
- % of restaurants providing online delivery : 25.66
- Ratio of restaurants that allow table booking vs that do not : 0.14

- Number of votes do not give a clear picture of how it may affect the rating of any particular restaurant as we do not see a significant rise in number of 
votes as the ratings increase 
- Table booking, online delivery, no. of cuisines served and price range are the important factors that affect the rating of a restaurant.
Whereas factors such as number of votes and average cost for two do not give a clear picture of how they affect the ratings
